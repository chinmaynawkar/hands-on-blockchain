# Zero-Knowledge Proof Demonstration App

An interactive web application that demonstrates Zero-Knowledge Proof concepts through a "Password Knowledge Proof" protocol. This app allows users to experience how secrets can be proven without revealing them, making complex cryptographic concepts accessible and engaging.

## üéØ Educational Goals

This demonstration is part of the comprehensive **Blockchain Learning Education Platform** and focuses on making Zero-Knowledge Proofs understandable through:

- **Interactive Learning**: Hands-on experience with ZKP protocols
- **Visual Progression**: Step-by-step protocol demonstration
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate understanding of each step
- **Accessible Explanations**: Complex concepts explained simply
- **Web3 Aesthetics**: Modern, engaging user interface

## üîê What You'll Learn

### Core ZKP Properties

- **Completeness**: Valid proofs always verify
- **Soundness**: Invalid proofs never verify
- **Zero-Knowledge**: No information leaks beyond validity

### Protocol Understanding

- Commitment schemes and their importance
- Challenge-response mechanisms
- Cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256)
- Modular arithmetic in cryptography
- Verification without secret disclosure

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm 8+
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No blockchain knowledge required (we'll teach you!)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the zkapp directory
cd zkapp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
```

### üìù Protocol Steps (Simplified)

1. **Enter a Secret**  
   The **Prover** chooses a password (the "secret") they want to prove they know.

2. **Generate Commitment**  
   The Prover locks their secret using a special math formula:  
   _(hashing the secret + a random number called a "nonce")_.  
   This "commitment" is like a **sealed envelope**‚Äîit proves they have a secret, but doesn‚Äôt reveal it.

3. **Receive Challenge**  
   The **Verifier** sends a random number (the "challenge") to the Prover.  
   This ensures the Prover can‚Äôt cheat by preparing answers in advance.

4. **Calculate Response**  
   The Prover uses their secret, the nonce, and the challenge to do a calculation, then sends the result (the "response") back.  
   This shows they know the secret, but still doesn‚Äôt reveal it.

5. **Verify Proof**  
   The Verifier checks the response using the commitment and challenge.  
   If it matches, they‚Äôre convinced the Prover knows the secret‚Äî**without ever seeing the secret itself**.

#### üóÇÔ∏è Summary of Terms

- **Commitment**: A hidden, locked version of the secret (like a sealed envelope).
- **Challenge**: A random test from the Verifier to keep things fair.
- **Response**: The Prover‚Äôs answer, showing they know the secret without revealing it.

### First Run Experience

1. **Enter a Secret**: Start by entering any password in the Prover panel
2. **Generate Commitment**: Watch as the secret is cryptographically committed
3. **Receive Challenge**: The Verifier generates a random challenge
4. **Calculate Response**: The Prover responds using the secret (without revealing it)
5. **Verify Proof**: The Verifier confirms knowledge without learning the secret

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Operation

- **Left Panel (Prover)**: The party proving knowledge of a secret
- **Right Panel (Verifier)**: The party verifying the proof
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows current step in the protocol
- **Help Panel**: Educational content and explanations

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `H` - Toggle help panel
- `R` - Reset protocol to start over

### Understanding the Flow

```
1. Secret Setup ‚Üí 2. Commitment ‚Üí 3. Challenge ‚Üí 4. Response ‚Üí 5. Verification
     (Prover)        (Prover)      (Verifier)    (Prover)     (Verifier)
```

Complete flow:
